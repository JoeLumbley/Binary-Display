# Binary Display

A interactive tool for visualizing binary numbers and their decimal equivalents. Designed to help learners explore bitwise representation through intuitive graphics, affirming sound effects, and real-time feedback.

### 🧠 Binary Basics

**Binary is a numbering system using only two digits 0 and 1**

### 🧮 Place Values in Binary

**Each bit has a place value, just like decimal — but based on powers of 2.**

---

### ✨ Features

- **Interactive Bit Toggling**: Click any of the 8 bit boxes to toggle between 0 and 1. Each change updates the binary string and decimal value instantly.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Use ↑ and ↓ keys to increment or decrement the binary value. Smooth transitions with auditory feedback.
- **Visual Breakdown**: Displays the decimal value and its binary decomposition (e.g., `32 + 8 + 2 = 42`) for deeper understanding.
- **Place Value Labels**: Each bit box is annotated with its corresponding power-of-two value (e.g., 128, 64, ..., 1).
- **Responsive Layout**: Automatically scales fonts and layout for HD/UHD resolutions and window resizing.
- **Ambient Sound Loop**: Background "ComputerPulsation" audio loops continuously to create an immersive experience.
- **Overlapping Sound Effects**: Instant playback of "CashCollected" sound on interaction, with overlapping enabled for responsiveness.

### 🔹 What’s a Bit?

**Each binary digit is called a _bit_.**

---


### 🎯 Educational Goals

This app is ideal for:
- Teaching binary concepts in a visually engaging way
- Reinforcing place value and bit significance
- Creating emotionally affirming learning environments with sound and color
- Demonstrating how binary maps to decimal in real time


---

### 🧱 What’s a Byte?

**A group of 8 bits is called a _byte_.**

---


### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **VB.NET WinForms**
- **System.Drawing** for custom rendering
- **Custom AudioPlayer** for sound layering and looping
- **Dynamic font scaling** for accessibility


---

### ⚡ Powers of 2

**Each place is a power of 2, from right to left.**

---

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Build and run the project in Visual Studio
3. Click or use arrow keys to explore binary values
4. Enjoy the sound-enhanced feedback loop!

### 🔢 Range of 8 Bits

**With 8 bits, we can represent numbers from 0 to 255:**


[ 8 Bits ]
[ 0000 0000 ]
[ 0 ]

[ 8 Bits ]
[ 1111 1111 ]
[ 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255 ]
