### ✨ Features

- **Interactive Bit Toggling**: Click any of the 8 bit boxes to toggle between 0 and 1. Each change updates the binary string and decimal value instantly.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Use ↑ and ↓ keys to increment or decrement the binary value. Smooth transitions with auditory feedback.
- **Visual Breakdown**: Displays the decimal value and its binary decomposition (e.g., `128 + 64 + 2 = 194`) for deeper understanding.
- **Place Value Labels**: Each bit box is annotated with its corresponding power-of-two value (e.g., 128, 64, ..., 1).
- **Responsive Layout**: Automatically scales fonts and layout for HD/UHD resolutions and window resizing.
- **Ambient Sound Loop**: Background "ComputerPulsation" audio loops continuously to create an immersive experience.
- **Overlapping Sound Effects**: Instant playback of "CashCollected" sound on interaction, with overlapping enabled for responsiveness.

### 🎯 Educational Goals

This app is ideal for:
- Teaching binary concepts in a visually engaging way
- Reinforcing place value and bit significance
- Creating emotionally affirming learning environments with sound and color
- Demonstrating how binary maps to decimal in real time

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **VB.NET WinForms**
